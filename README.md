SET: After reclaiming Ivory's corpse from STARVE's house, having just returned home. 

* Caroline gives herself just one more jolt. She just needs to finish the day.
Caroline: come bastard, here
Caroline: good boy
| The hound had earned more than his keep tonight.
Caroline: ...Something. I think this is my limit

| It couldn't blame her.
Caroline: is- is it too much? to not? like-
Caroline: to trust people wont fucking steal from a grave?
Caroline: i will. use those iron bars. maybe. but i might just-
Caroline: i dont know. i might bury her somewhere else. lie that shes there.

Caroline: it sounds scummy. i dont know
| It might be wise. This world grows stranger.
* Caroline is still holding ivory's corpse. its raining though, and she doesnt feel like digging in the mud.
Caroline: ill....
Caroline: ugh.

| Where would she hide the new grave?
Caroline: ...unsure.
* Caroline rifles through her cabinets with her free hand, taking a towel and replacing the soaked blankets.
Caroline: ...ill....dig somewhere nice later.
* Caroline sends a jolt to her arm holding ivory, its joints locked up.

Caroline: ...ivory would find this part funny
* Caroline sets ivory down in the meat locker. it feels Wrong but its a place mervin wont walk into a Corpse Being There.
* it works until she can. bury her. when its not raining.

| Keep it well locked until then.
Caroline: ...will do. but- i. uh. ill probably
(Ivory's eye opens when she is set down. It is yellow)
* Caroline chokes down a sick feeling.
* Caroline can't vomit. but. christ.

| ??????: We're sorry..
| ??????: We've done this too many times to count. It never gets easier.
Caroline: ...
* she gently reaches forward and closes the eye.
Caroline: ...

| ??????: You should both be allowed some peace after this.
Caroline: ...ive...never done this before.
Caroline: the grief thing- i- ...i guess the most ive done is mourn uh. my own death. haha
* Caroline runs a hand through her hair.
(She, with minimal strength, hits her head on the meat locker wall a few times before leaving.)

| Something puts a hand on her shoulder, trying to keep her from banging against the wall.
Caroline: its fine- its fine
Caroline: it only jostles a few wires. my main memories in my chest
Caroline: head is just short term.
| The sound of footsteps are keeping pace with her.

* Caroline is hurrying back and forth between the portal and her house, she enters the nether and begins to cover up the portal with Terracotta- to make it look more naturally gone.
Caroline: mervins gonna be mad at me for this. what ever
Caroline: people will ignore signs.
Caroline: ...hiding it better than that. not that its not. obvious it was there.
Caroline: ...but hopefully the uh. message. gets across.

| ??????: A friend of ours did this once.
Caroline: ...ah.
| ??????: We don't remember why. [Someone had hurt her. Who was it...]
Caroline: ...i uh.
Caroline: ...

| * ?????? hums for a moment, before...
| You hear a resonating shatter from under the terracotta.
* Caroline flinches violently.
| ??????: The frame remains alone.
| ??????: Cover it.

| ??????: We can return it, break it, or write you home if needed.
Caroline: ...might need...writed home. uh. id walk but my- uh
Caroline: my batterys 0. im running on fumes-
Caroline: i can uh.
| ??????: Say the word when.

Caroline: i can do this thing where i just...give myself like- a jolt. like. activating all my muscles at once.
* She takes a moment to finish up covering the now broken portal.
Caroline: .....please

| You hear a quill scratching on parchment.
